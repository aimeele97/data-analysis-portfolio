## About

I graduated in 2022 with a Master's degree in International Business from Australia. My career began in diverse sectors, including manufacturing, retail, hospitality, and freight forwarding, where I held roles such as Office Administrator, Financial Specialist, and Logistics Coordinator.

In these positions, I honed my skills in:

- Problem Solving: Developed strategies to address complex challenges across different business environments.
Analytics: Utilized data to drive decision-making and optimize operations.
- Logistical Thinking: Managed supply chains and logistics to enhance efficiency.
- Collaboration: Worked effectively with cross-functional teams to achieve business objectives.

I possess a solid understanding of business operations and can navigate challenges in various sectors. As a proactive individual, I excel at multitasking and thrive in independent settings. My curiosity drives me to learn quickly and apply insights to real-world problems.

I am now seeking a data analyst position to leverage my skills in Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau. I aim to provide upper management with clear insights into business challenges and collaborate with teams to develop effective strategies for driving success.
